    <h1>Terms & Condation</h1>
    <div>
        <p><b>A Terms and Conditions agreement explains:
            <Ul types="disc">
            <li>How consumers may use the website</li>
            <li>Rights and responsibilities of parties</li>
           <li> What you are (and are not) liable for</li>
           <li>Who customers can turn to if there's a problem with the sale</li> 
            </Ul>
            A Terms and Conditions agreement is a contract which spells out exactly what the legal relationship is between the store and the consumer. The agreement should be easy to understand and readily accessible. Most importantly, you shouldn't stuff your Terms and Conditions with complex legal language.
            
            Without Terms and Conditions, it's unclear what the consumer can expect from you, and it's more difficult for you to take action if a user abuses your service.</b></p>

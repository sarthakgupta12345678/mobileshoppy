        <b>A Privacy Policy outlines your methods for collecting, storing, using and sharing personal information from your online customers.

        This includes information you collect directly, such as through opt-in forms and your shopping cart checkout page, and indirectly such as by monitoring browser clicks, time spent on a page, interaction with ads, etc.</b>
        <br><b> A Privacy Policy agreement for your ecommerce store is not only required by law, but it also builds trust with your customers and ensures that you stay in line with your legal obligations.

        If you already have this agreement for your store, make sure to follow these tips:
        
            Disclose what kind of personal information you're collecting from your customers
            Disclose how the collected information may be shared or disclosed with third parties your store might be using (Google Analytics, Google AdWords, Google AdSense etc.)
            Inform how customers can review and change the information collected on them
            Make sure to include the policy's effective date</b>
